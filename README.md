# M-Expense - Expense Management App
This Mobile App Prototype has been developed for the Mobile Application coursework at the University of Greenwich as part of the fulfillment of the Digital Media Design and Development Degree using Android Studio Software and Java Programming language.

# Scenario

Often employees are able to claim expenses for travel that they have to undertake in order to do their jobs. For instance, an employee who usually works in London may have to travel to Plymouth for a meeting. They could
claim for the transport costs (e.g., underground, train and bus) and also for lunch and refreshments or accommodation.

Therfore the goal of this project is to create a mobile app for use by employees that they can use to record details of their expenses and then upload them to their employerâ€™s server.
